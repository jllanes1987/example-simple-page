# example-simple-page

Some things to specify:

1. I would like to say that I have access to codes from my previus jobs, but I don't feel confortable giving the work I did for other companies, for reasons of confidentiality. Here you will find a small example I did in order to show how I work.
2. For the example I use:
  - MySql for DB
  - php using CakePHP 3.2.12 framework
  - Bootstrap, jQuery
  - Some functions: login(User => "John", Password => "123456"), manage entities(users, products, categories), show products by category, add product to cart, view/delete/addCount products in my cart.
  - Access to frontend: http://localhost/example-simple-page/frontend
  - Access to backend: http://localhost/example-simple-page/users/login
  - IDE: phpStorm 2016
  - Websites where I worked and are visibles on Internet, the others only are visibles inside Cuba. In all cases respecting the designer's proposal:
