# example-simple-page

Some things to specify:

1. I would like to say that I have access to codes from my previus jobs, but I don't feel confortable giving the work I did for other companies, for reasons of confidentiality. Here you will find a small example I did in order to show how I work. 
2. You will find also the Reference folder with URLs of some sites that I did and the Code file with some functions.
3. For the example I use:
  - MySql for DB
  - php using CakePHP 3.2.12 framework
  - Bootstrap, jQuery
  - Some functions: login, manage entities(users, products, categories), show products by category, add product to cart, view/delete/addCount products in my cart.
  - IDE: phpStorm 2016
