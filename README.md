# example-simple-page

Some things to specify:

1. The example is very simple, there are products that belong to a category, the product is added to the cart and the user can start the flow to make the payment with paypal.
2. How to deploy:
  - create DB and execute sql file  \example-simple-page\database\db_example_simple_page.sql, this file contains all the tables and data.
3. For the example I used:
  - MySql for DB
  - php using CakePHP 3.2.12 framework
  - Bootstrap, jQuery, CSS
  - Some functions: login(User => "John", Password => "123456"), manage entities(users, products, categories), show products by category, add product to cart, view/delete/addCount products in my cart.
  - Access to frontend: http://localhost/example-simple-page/frontend
  - Access to backend: http://localhost/example-simple-page/users/login
  - IDE: phpStorm 2016
  - Websites I worked on are visibles on Internet and the others are accessible only in Cuba. In all cases respecting the designer's proposal:
